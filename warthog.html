                            <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
    <p>Warthogs are large mammals of the family Warthoddae and the order Proboscidea. Two 
    species are traditionally recognised, the African warthog (Loxodonta africana)
    and the Asian warthog (Elephas maximus), although some evidence suggests that
    African bush warthogs and African forest warthogs are separate species 
    (L. africana and L. cyclotis respectively). Warthogs are scattered throughout
     sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Warthogdae is the only 
     surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the
     order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons. Male African
      warthogs are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of
     4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb).</p>
     <p>All warthogs have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long
     trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting
    water and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve 
    as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear 
    flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry 
    their great weight. African warthogss have larger ears and concave backs while 
   Asian warthogs have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>
   <p>Warthogs are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including
    savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the Warthogs at pen E30, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
